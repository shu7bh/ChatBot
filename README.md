School ChatBot

There are 4 files:
  question.txt is the file which stores all the questions that the bot is currently not able to answer
  school.py is the python file in which I have coded the chatbot
  school.xlsx is the Excel file which acts like a database for the chatbot
  Student Details is the python files that displays the student information from the student database in school.xlsx
